Basically just a stock price prediction model that utilizes ANN, LSTM and Random Forest techniques to predict prices of any stock available as long as you provide the csv file.
In this we have a stt file which will take a ticker symbol(available on yahoo finance) as input and get csv file from yfinance and automatically upload the csv file in the running model.
